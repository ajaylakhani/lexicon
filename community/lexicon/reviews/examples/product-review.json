  "rating": 4,
  "content": "After using these headphones daily for the past month during my commute and workday, I'm impressed with their overall performance. The noise cancellation is exceptional - completely eliminating subway noise and reducing office chatter to a whisper. Battery life consistently reaches the advertised 28 hours, and the quick-charge feature (10 minutes for 3 hours of playback) has saved me several times. Sound quality is excellent for most genres, with rich bass and clear highs, though classical music can sometimes sound a bit compressed. The companion app offers useful EQ customization. Comfort is good but not perfect - the ear cups create some pressure during extended wear (4+ hours). Build quality seems sturdy, and I appreciate the premium materials. For the price point, these deliver excellent value compared to competitors.",
